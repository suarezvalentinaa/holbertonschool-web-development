# HTML Structure Project

Welcome to the first step of building a webpage from scratch! This project focuses exclusively on **HTML structure**—no CSS or styling is required at this stage. The goal is to translate the designer file into a clean, semantic HTML markup.

---

## Project Overview

In this and upcoming projects, you will implement a webpage based on a **Figma designer file**. The purpose of this first project is to **focus entirely on HTML**:

- Use semantic tags wherever possible (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`, etc.)
- Maintain a clean and organized structure
- No CSS or styling is required yet
- Focus on accessibility and clarity in your markup

## Project Requirements

- Implement the **HTML structure only**
- Follow **semantic HTML principles**
- Use meaningful tag names and nesting
- Keep your code readable and well-indented
- No CSS or external styling should be applied in this stage
- File should be saved as `index.html` in the project root

---

## How to Use

1. Open the Figma designer file
2. Study the layout and hierarchy of sections
3. Create `index.html` and start building the structure
4. Check your HTML for semantic correctness

---

## Future Steps

In upcoming projects, you will:

- Add **CSS styling** based on the design

---

## Notes

- Focus on **clarity and semantic correctness**
- Comment your code if necessary to explain sections
- Think of accessibility and structure from the start
